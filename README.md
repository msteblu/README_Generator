## Description

This is a command-line application that quickly generates a README.md file from user input (using the npm Inquirer package). README's are such an important part of projects on GitHub, and this application allows for users to quickly get a quality README.md created for their projects.

## Installation

This application is written in JavaScript and is accessible through the command-line. Clone and download the files from this repository, and then install the npm Inquirer package into the downloaded directory in order to use this application. 
    
## Usage

After download, run the application using Node.js by typing "node index.js" into the command-line. The application will prompt you with questions, which you can type out and answer (for questions that ask for user input) or you can select a choice by using the spacebar (for questions that give you choices). Once all the questions are answered, it will generate a README.md file with all of the user input.
